based in code by Morag Williams, July 2015

 A C++ code to replace the existing LED LabVIEW code. The code will turn on and off the LEDs automatically.
 													
 Command line arguments, in order: internal reference, bitmap, current, dac address, USB port.

 	internal reference: 	on or off
 	bitmap: 		to turn on the 1st LED = 1, 2nd = 2, 3rd = 4, ..., 8th = 128, all = 255.
 	current: 		changes the current to, and therefore the brightness of the LEDs (in mA).
 	dac address: 		For *   type *
				DAC A	A
				DAC B	B
				DAC C	C
				DAC D	D
				DAC E	E
				DAC F	F
				DAC G	G  
				DAC H	H
				All DAC	a 
	USBport:		enter the value of the correct USB port for the device.

 Example call: (to turn on all the LEDs with a current of 10mA, use DAC address A and use USB port 0)
 	sudo ./LED on 255 10 A 0
